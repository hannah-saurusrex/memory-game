# A checklist of things the game needs to do:

1. Cards are to be shuffled on load or restart
2. Game should know how to handle matched and unmatched cards
3. Game should display the current number of moves a user has made
4. The game should show a star rating (from 1–3) that reflects the player’s performance based on the number of moves made.
5. When a player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start and once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
6. A restart button should allow the player to reset the game board, timer, and the star rating.
7. A congratulations modal should appear when the player wins while showing a button to play again and modal should show: How much time it took, and star rating.
