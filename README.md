# A checklist of things the game needs to do:

1. Cards are to be shuffled on load or restart
2. Game should know how to handle matched and unmatched cards (does the card stay flipped over? What color does the card need to be?)
3. Stats modal should show:
3a. Current number of moves a user has made
3b. Star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance based on number of moves made
3c. Start the timer to show time elapsed when a player starts a game
3d. A restart button should allow a player to reset the game board, timer, and star rating.
7. A congratulations modal should appear when the player wins while showing a button to play again and modal should show: How much time it took, and star rating.
